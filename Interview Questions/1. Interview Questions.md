##  Beginner-Level JavaScript Interview Questions
### 1. What is JavaScript?
- JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted scripting language used to make web pages interactive. 
- It runs in the browser and enables dynamic features such as form validation, content updates, animations, and event handling. 
- JavaScript is a core web technology alongside HTML and CSS and supports multiple programming paradigms like object-oriented, functional, and event-driven programming.
- With the help of Node.js, JavaScript can also be used for server-side development, making it a full-stack language.

### 2. What are the data types in JavaScript?

JavaScript has **two main categories** of data types:

### 🔹 1. Primitive Data Types
These are immutable and stored by value.

- **String** – Textual data.  
  _Example_: `"Hello"`
- **Number** – Any numeric value (integer or float).  
  _Example_: `42`, `3.14`
- **Boolean** – Logical value: `true` or `false`
- **Undefined** – A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.  
  _Example_: `let x; // x is undefined`
- **Null** – Represents intentional absence of any object value.  
  _Example_: `let y = null;`
- **BigInt** – Used for very large integers.  
  _Example_: `1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n`
- **Symbol** – Unique and immutable value, often used as object keys.  
  _Example_: `let sym = Symbol("id");`


### 🔹 2. Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types
Stored by reference and used to store collections of data.

- **Object** – A collection of key-value pairs.  
  _Example_: `{ name: "John", age: 25 }`
- **Array** – An ordered list of values.  
  _Example_: `[1, 2, 3]`
- **Function** – A block of code that can be called and executed.  
  _Example_: `function greet() { console.log("Hello"); }`

### 3. What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`?

- **Scope:**
  - `var` is function-scoped.
  - `let` and `const` are block-scoped (inside `{}`).

- **Hoisting:**
  - `var` declarations are hoisted and initialized with `undefined`.
  - `let` and `const` are hoisted but not initialized (temporal dead zone), so accessing them before declaration causes a ReferenceError.

- **Reassignment:**
  - `var` and `let` can be reassigned.
  - `const` cannot be reassigned after its initial assignment.

- **Redeclaration:**
  - `var` allows redeclaration within the same scope.
  - `let` and `const` do not allow redeclaration in the same scope.

- **Use case:**
  - Use `var` mainly for legacy code.
  - Use `let` for variables that need to be reassigned.
  - Use `const` for constants or variables that shouldn’t be reassigned.

**Example:**

```javascript
function example() {
  var x = 1;
  let y = 2;
  const z = 3;

  if(true) {
    var x = 10; // same variable, function scope
    let y = 20; // different variable, block scope
    // z = 30; // Error: Assignment to constant variable
  }

  console.log(x); // 10
  console.log(y); // 2
  console.log(z); // 3
}
```

### 5. Explain the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript
- In JavaScript, `==` and `===` are comparison operators used to compare two values, but they behave differently:

| Operator | Name                | Behavior                                 | Type Coercion           | Example                         | Result         |
|----------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------|
| `==`     | Loose equality      | Compares values for equality after **type coercion** (converts types if needed) | Yes                    | `'5' == 5`                     | `true`         |
| `===`    | Strict equality     | Compares values for equality **without type coercion** (both value and type must be the same) | No                     | `'5' === 5`                    | `false`        |

#### Detailed Explanation:

- **`==` (Loose Equality):**  
  - Converts the operands to the same type before comparison.  
  - Performs type coercion, which can lead to unexpected results.  
  - Useful when you want to check value equality regardless of type, but can be error-prone.

- **`===` (Strict Equality):**  
  - Checks both value and type without any conversion.  
  - More predictable and recommended for most cases.  
  - Avoids bugs due to implicit type conversions.

#### Examples:

```js
5 == '5';      // true (string '5' is converted to number 5)
5 === '5';     // false (number vs string)
0 == false;    // true (false is converted to 0)
0 === false;   // false (number vs boolean)
null == undefined;  // true (special case)
null === undefined; // false

### 6. What are truthy and falsy values in JavaScript?
**Definition:**
- In JavaScript, every value is either **truthy** or **falsy** when evaluated in a Boolean context (like in `if` statements, logical operations, etc.).
- **Truthy values** evaluate to `true`.
- **Falsy values** evaluate to `false`.


### Falsy Values in JavaScript

There are exactly **7 falsy values** in JavaScript:

1. `false`  
2. `0` (number zero)  
3. `-0` (negative zero)  
4. `""` (empty string)  
5. `null`  
6. `undefined`  
7. `NaN` (Not a Number)  

These values behave like `false` in conditional checks.


### Truthy Values in JavaScript

- All values that are **not falsy** are considered **truthy**.
- This includes non-empty strings, numbers other than zero, objects, arrays, functions, etc.
- For example: `"0"`, `"false"`, `{}`, `[]`, `42`, `true` are all truthy.


### Why does it matter?

- JavaScript automatically converts values to Boolean in contexts like conditions, loops, logical operators.
- Understanding truthy and falsy values helps prevent bugs and write cleaner code.


### Example:

```javascript
if ("hello") {
  console.log("This is truthy"); // This will run
}

if (0) {
  console.log("This won't run"); // Because 0 is falsy
}
```

## 🧠 Intermediate-Level JavaScript Interview Questions
### 1. What is a closure in JavaScript?
- 
- 
### 2. Explain scope and types of scope in JavaScript.
### What is Scope?
- **Scope** in JavaScript refers to the accessibility or visibility of variables in different parts of your code.
- It determines where variables can be declared, accessed, and modified.

### Types of Scope in JavaScript
1. **Global Scope**
- Variables declared outside any function/block.
- Accessible anywhere in the code.
- Example:
```javascript
let globalVar = "I am global";

function show() {
  console.log(globalVar); // ✅ Accessible
}
```
2. **Function Scope (Local Scope)**
- Variables declared inside a function using var, let, or const.
- Accessible only within that function.
- Example:
```javascript
function greet() {
  let name = "Alice";
  console.log(name); // ✅ Accessible here
}
console.log(name); // ❌ ReferenceError
```
3. **Block Scope**
- Introduced in ES6 with let and const.
- Variables are only accessible within the block {} where they are defined.
- Example:
```javascript
if (true) {
  let x = 10;
  const y = 20;
}
console.log(x); // ❌ Error
```
4. **Lexical (Static) Scope**
- Functions in JavaScript are lexically scoped, meaning:
- A function’s scope is determined by where it’s defined, not where it’s called.
- Example:
```javascript
function outer() {
  let a = "outer";

  function inner() {
    console.log(a); // ✅ Has access to parent scope
  }

  inner();
}
```

2. **Explain the concept of closures with an example.**
3. **What is the difference between `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()`?**
4. **What is currying in JavaScript?**
5. **How does JavaScript handle asynchronous operations internally?**

7. **Explain the module system in JavaScript (`import/export`).**
8. **What are higher-order functions?**
9. **How does JavaScript handle memory management?**
10. **What is debouncing and throttling?**
- **Debouncing** and **throttling** are techniques in JavaScript used to control how often a function is executed, especially in response to high-frequency events like scroll, resize, or keypress.

### Debouncing
- Debouncing ensures a function is executed only after a specified delay once the event stops firing.
- **Use Case**: Search input, resize window
- **Example**: Delay API call until user stops typing
```javascript
function debounce(fn, delay) {
  let timer;
  return (...args) => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => fn.apply(this, args), delay);
  };
}
```

### Throttling
- **Throttling** ensures a function is executed at most once every X milliseconds, no matter how many times the event fires.
- **Use Case**: Scroll tracking, analytics events
- **Example**: Log position while scrolling every 500ms

```javascript
function throttle(fn, limit) {
  let lastCall = 0;
  return (...args) => {
    const now = Date.now();
    if (now - lastCall >= limit) {
      lastCall = now;
      fn.apply(this, args);
    }
  };
}
```
