##  Beginner-Level JavaScript Interview Questions
### 1. What is JavaScript?
- JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted scripting language used to make web pages interactive. 
- It runs in the browser and enables dynamic features such as form validation, content updates, animations, and event handling. 
- JavaScript is a core web technology alongside HTML and CSS and supports multiple programming paradigms like object-oriented, functional, and event-driven programming.
- With the help of Node.js, JavaScript can also be used for server-side development, making it a full-stack language.

### 2. What are the data types in JavaScript?

JavaScript has **two main categories** of data types:

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Primitive Data Types
These are immutable and stored by value.

- **String** â€“ Textual data.  
  _Example_: `"Hello"`
- **Number** â€“ Any numeric value (integer or float).  
  _Example_: `42`, `3.14`
- **Boolean** â€“ Logical value: `true` or `false`
- **Undefined** â€“ A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.  
  _Example_: `let x; // x is undefined`
- **Null** â€“ Represents intentional absence of any object value.  
  _Example_: `let y = null;`
- **BigInt** â€“ Used for very large integers.  
  _Example_: `1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n`
- **Symbol** â€“ Unique and immutable value, often used as object keys.  
  _Example_: `let sym = Symbol("id");`


### ðŸ”¹ 2. Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types
Stored by reference and used to store collections of data.

- **Object** â€“ A collection of key-value pairs.  
  _Example_: `{ name: "John", age: 25 }`
- **Array** â€“ An ordered list of values.  
  _Example_: `[1, 2, 3]`
- **Function** â€“ A block of code that can be called and executed.  
  _Example_: `function greet() { console.log("Hello"); }`

### 3. What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`?

- **Scope:**
  - `var` is function-scoped.
  - `let` and `const` are block-scoped (inside `{}`).

- **Hoisting:**
  - `var` declarations are hoisted and initialized with `undefined`.
  - `let` and `const` are hoisted but not initialized (temporal dead zone), so accessing them before declaration causes a ReferenceError.

- **Reassignment:**
  - `var` and `let` can be reassigned.
  - `const` cannot be reassigned after its initial assignment.

- **Redeclaration:**
  - `var` allows redeclaration within the same scope.
  - `let` and `const` do not allow redeclaration in the same scope.

- **Use case:**
  - Use `var` mainly for legacy code.
  - Use `let` for variables that need to be reassigned.
  - Use `const` for constants or variables that shouldnâ€™t be reassigned.

**Example:**

```javascript
function example() {
  var x = 1;
  let y = 2;
  const z = 3;

  if(true) {
    var x = 10; // same variable, function scope
    let y = 20; // different variable, block scope
    // z = 30; // Error: Assignment to constant variable
  }

  console.log(x); // 10
  console.log(y); // 2
  console.log(z); // 3
}
```
