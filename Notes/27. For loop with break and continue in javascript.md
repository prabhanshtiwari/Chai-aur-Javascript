**JavaScript Loops and Iterations: Detailed Notes**

---

### 1. **For Loop**

**Syntax:**

```javascript
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // Code block to be executed
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Initialization**: Executed once before the loop starts.
* **Condition**: Evaluated before each loop iteration.
* **Increment/Decrement**: Executed after each iteration.
* Used when the number of iterations is known.

**Code Snippet:**

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
    const element = i;
    if (element == 5) {
        // console.log(`5 is best number`);
    }
    // console.log(element);
}
```

**Key Points:**

* Prints numbers from 0 to 10.
* Shows a message when the number is 5.
* `element` is block-scoped using `let`.

---

### 2. **Nested For Loop**

**Code Snippet:**

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j <= 10; j++) {
        // console.log(`${i} * ${j} = ${i * j}`);
    }
}
```

**Key Points:**

* Useful for creating multiplication tables.
* Outer loop runs from 1 to 10.
* Inner loop also runs from 1 to 10, for each iteration of the outer loop.

---

### 3. **Array Iteration Using For Loop**

**Code Snippet:**

```javascript
let myArray = ["flash", "batman", "superman"];
for (let index = 0; index < myArray.length; index++) {
    const element = myArray[index];
    // console.log(element);
}
```

**Key Points:**

* Iterates over each item in the array.
* `myArray.length` determines the loop count.
* Accesses each element via index.

---

### 4. **Break Statement**

**Code Snippet:**

```javascript
for (let index = 1; index <= 20; index++) {
    if (index === 5) {
        console.log(`Detected 5`);
        break;
    }
    console.log(`Value of index is ${index}`);
}
```

**Key Points:**

* Loop stops entirely when `index === 5`.
* Used for early exit from loops.

---

### 5. **Continue Statement**

**Code Snippet:**

```javascript
for (let index = 1; index <= 20; index++) {
    if (index === 5) {
        console.log(`Detected 5`);
        continue;
    }
    console.log(`Value of index is ${index}`);
}
```

**Key Points:**

* Skips the iteration when `index === 5`.
* Continues with the next iteration.

### ðŸš« Difference Between `break` and `continue`

| Statement  | Behavior                                              |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `break`    | Exits the loop completely.                            |
| `continue` | Skips the current iteration, continues with the next. |

---

### ðŸ“Œ Summary & Takeaways

* Loops help in executing code repeatedly.
* `for` loop is ideal when the number of iterations is known.
* Nested loops are useful for tabular or matrix-based operations.
* Use `break` to exit loops early, `continue` to skip specific iterations.
* Array iteration with loops is fundamental in real-world JavaScript development.
