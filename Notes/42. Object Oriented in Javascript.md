# 🧠 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript

---

## ❓ Does JavaScript Have Classes?

### ✅ Short Answer (for Interviews):

Yes, JavaScript has classes, introduced in ES6 (2015), but they are syntactic sugar over the existing prototype-based inheritance.

### 🧠 Expanded Answer:

JavaScript is fundamentally prototype-based. When you create a class in JavaScript using the `class` keyword, it is just a cleaner, more readable way of setting up functions and prototypes underneath. It helps developers familiar with class-based languages like Java or C++ to write OOP-style code.

## 🎯 Programming Paradigms in JavaScript

* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
* **Functional Programming**

---

## 🤖 Objects in JavaScript

* Objects are collections of **properties** (data) and **methods** (functions).

* Example:

  ```js
  const user = {
    username: "hitesh",
    loginCount: 8,
    signedIn: true,
    getUserDetails: function() {
      console.log(this); // refers to 'user' object
    }
  };
  ```

* `this` keyword: Inside `getUserDetails`, `this` refers to the object that called the method (`user` in this case).

---

## 🧱 Why Use OOP in JavaScript?

### Problems in unstructured code:

* **Spaghetti code**: Complex and tangled code that's hard to manage or reuse.

### OOP Benefits:

* Modular code
* Reusability
* Scalability
* Easier debugging and testing

# ⚙️ Core Parts of OOP in JavaScript

---

## 🔹 1. Object Literal

An object created manually using `{}`:

```js
const user = {
  username: 'hitesh',
  loginCount: 8,
  signedIn: true,
  getUserDetails: function() {
    console.log(this); // Refers to the current object
  }
};
```

Drawbacks:

* Cannot easily create multiple instances (blueprints/templates needed)

---

## 🔹 2. Constructor Functions

Used to create multiple object instances with shared structure:

```js
function User(username, loginCount, isLoggedIn) {
  this.username = username;
  this.loginCount = loginCount;
  this.isLoggedIn = isLoggedIn;

  // returning 'this' is optional with 'new'
  return this;
}
```

Usage:

```js
const userOne = new User('hitesh', 8, true);
const userTwo = new User('john', 5, false);
```

### 🔑 Key Concepts:

* `new` keyword:

  1. Creates a new empty object: `{}`
  2. Sets the context of `this` to the new object
  3. Calls the constructor function
  4. Links the new object to the prototype
  5. Returns the new object

* `this`: Refers to the new object being created.

* `userOne instanceof User` → `true`

---

## 🔹 3. Prototypes

Every function in JavaScript has a `prototype` property that is used for inheritance.

```js
User.prototype.incrementLogin = function() {
  this.loginCount++;
};
```

Benefits:

* Methods are shared between instances.
* Efficient memory usage (no duplication of methods).

---

## 🔹 4. Classes (ES6)

Syntactic sugar over constructor functions and prototypes.

```js
class User {
  constructor(username, loginCount, isLoggedIn) {
    this.username = username;
    this.loginCount = loginCount;
    this.isLoggedIn = isLoggedIn;
  }

  getUserDetails() {
    console.log(`Username: ${this.username}`);
  }
}
```

Usage:

```js
const userOne = new User("hitesh", 10, true);
```

---

# ⚡ Instances and `this`

## 🔹 Instances

Objects created from a constructor or class using `new`:

```js
const user1 = new User("alice", 3, true);
```

## 🔹 `this` Keyword

* Inside object literal: refers to the object
* Inside constructor/class: refers to the instance being created
* In global scope (non-strict): refers to `window` (in browsers)

---

## ❗ Without `new` Keyword

```js
const user = User('hitesh', 8, true); // 'this' will refer to global object
```

Results in properties being attached to the global object (undesired).

# 💡 Four Pillars of OOP

## 🔸 1. Abstraction

* Hiding complex implementation details.
* Example: `fetch()` hides internal XMLHttpRequest logic.

## 🔸 2. Encapsulation

* Bundling data and functions into a single unit (class).
* Protects internal state using closures or private properties (from ES2022: `#` syntax).

## 🔸 3. Inheritance

* One class can extend another, sharing methods and properties.

```js
class Admin extends User {
  constructor(username, loginCount, isLoggedIn, role) {
    super(username, loginCount, isLoggedIn);
    this.role = role;
  }
}
```

## 🔸 4. Polymorphism

* Same method behaves differently in different classes.

```js
class Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log("Animal speaks");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log("Dog barks");
  }
}
```

| `new` Keyword          | Creates an instance, binds `this` | `new User(...)`               |
| `this` Keyword         | Refers to calling context         | `this.username = ...`         |
| `prototype`            | Share methods across instances    | `User.prototype.method = ...` |
| `class`                | Modern syntax for OOP             | `class User {}`               |
