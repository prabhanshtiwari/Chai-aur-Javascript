# JavaScript Code Execution – Interview Notes (Detailed)

---

## How Does JavaScript Execute Code?

JavaScript is a **single-threaded**, **synchronous** language that uses:

- **Execution Contexts**: The environment in which code is evaluated.
- **Call Stack**: A stack data structure to track which function is currently running and what gets executed next.

When a JavaScript program runs:

1. A **Global Execution Context (GEC)** is created first.
2. Functions are executed within their own **Function Execution Contexts (FEC)**.
3. All these contexts are managed in a **Call Stack**, with LIFO behavior.

---

## What is an Execution Context?

An **Execution Context** is an environment where JavaScript code is evaluated and executed. It includes:

- **Memory Component (Variable Environment)**: Stores variables and function declarations.
- **Code Component (Thread of Execution)**: Executes the code line-by-line.
- **`this` Binding**: Depends on how the code is invoked.

### Types of Execution Contexts:

1. **Global Execution Context (GEC)**
   - Created by default when the JavaScript file runs.
   - Binds the `this` keyword to the global object.
     - In browser: `window`
     - In Node.js: `global`

2. **Function Execution Context (FEC)**
   - Created whenever a function is invoked.
   - Has its own:
     - Variable Environment
     - Scope Chain
     - `this` value

3. **Eval Execution Context**
   - Created when the `eval()` function is used (rarely recommended).
   - Can execute a string of JavaScript code.

---

## Global Execution Context in the Browser

- The first execution context that is created.
- Binds `this` to the `window` object.
- All variables and functions declared globally are attached to the `window` object.

```js
console.log(this); // window
```

## JavaScript Execution – The Two Phases

JavaScript code is executed in **two main phases**:

### 1️⃣ Memory Creation Phase (Creation Phase)

- Space is allocated for:
  - Variables → initially set to `undefined`
  - Function declarations → stored entirely
- `this` is initialized
  - In browser: `this = window`

Example:

```js
let val1 = 10;
function addNum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

Memory Phase Output:

| Identifier | Value           |
|------------|-----------------|
| val1       | undefined       |
| addNum     | function(){...} |
| this       | window          |

---

### 2️⃣ Execution Phase

- Variables are assigned actual values
- Functions are invoked (which triggers creation of FEC)

Continuing the example:

```js
let val1 = 10; // val1 = 10
let result = addNum(5, 3); // triggers Function Execution Context
```

---

## Functional Execution Context (FEC)

Every time a function is called:

1. A **new execution context** is created.
2. It goes through the same two phases (Memory + Execution).
3. It is pushed to the **Call Stack**.
4. After function returns, it is popped off the Call Stack.

Inside the FEC:

- **Arguments** passed to the function
- **Local Variables**
- **Return values**

Example:

```js
function addNum(a, b) {
  let total = a + b;
  return total;
}
```

FEC Memory Phase:

| Identifier | Value     |
|------------|-----------|
| a          | undefined |
| b          | undefined |
| total      | undefined |

FEC Execution Phase:

| Identifier | Value |
|------------|-------|
| a          | 5     |
| b          | 3     |
| total      | 8     |

---

## Call Stack in JavaScript

The **Call Stack** is a mechanism that JavaScript uses to keep track of function calls.

### Characteristics:

- **LIFO** (Last In, First Out)
- When a function is invoked:
  - Its execution context is **pushed** onto the stack
- When it returns:
  - The context is **popped** off the stack

Example:

```js
function one() {
  two();
}

function two() {
  console.log("Two");
}

one();
```

Stack Flow:

```
Initial → [Global Context]
Call one() → [one, Global]
Call two() → [two, one, Global]
Return → [one, Global]
Return → [Global]
```

---

## Is JavaScript Single-Threaded?

Yes. JavaScript runs on a **single-threaded** model:

- **One Call Stack**
- **One Memory Heap**
- **One thread of execution**

Asynchronous tasks (like `setTimeout`, `fetch`, etc.) are handled using:

- **Web APIs**
- **Callback Queue**
- **Event Loop**

But the execution still happens one at a time via the **Call Stack**.

---

## Execution Contexts Across Runtimes

Every JavaScript runtime has:

| Runtime | Global Object |
|---------|---------------|
| Browser | `window`      |
| Node.js | `global`      |
| Deno    | `globalThis`  |
| Bun     | `globalThis`  |

Execution context **concept stays the same** across all runtimes. What changes is the global object and available APIs.

## How to Add JavaScript Files in Browsers

### 1. Inline JavaScript

```html
<script>
  alert("Hello!");
</script>
```

### 2. Internal JavaScript

```html
<head>
  <script>
    console.log("Inside Head");
  </script>
</head>
```

### 3. External JavaScript

```html
<script src="app.js"></script>
```

**Best practice:** Use **external JS** and include it **before closing the body tag** or with `defer`:

```html
<script src="app.js" defer></script>
```

## Debugging Call Stack in Browser

You can observe the **Call Stack** in browser developer tools:

1. Open **DevTools**
2. Go to **Sources > Snippets**
3. Write your JS code
4. Use `debugger;` keyword or set breakpoints
5. View **Call Stack** in the right panel

Example:

```js
function greet() {
  debugger;
  console.log("Hi");
}
greet();
```

## Summary Table

| Concept              | Description                                 |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Execution Context     | Environment where JS is evaluated           |
| GEC                  | Created first; only one per JS program      |
| FEC                  | Created every time a function is called     |
| Eval Context         | Created when using `eval()` (rare use case) |
| Memory Phase         | Allocates memory, sets vars to `undefined`  |
| Execution Phase      | Executes line-by-line and assigns values    |
| Call Stack           | Tracks execution contexts using LIFO        |
| `this` in Browser    | Refers to `window`                          |
| Single-threaded      | JS runs one task at a time                  |
| Adding JS to Browser | Inline, Internal, or External               |
