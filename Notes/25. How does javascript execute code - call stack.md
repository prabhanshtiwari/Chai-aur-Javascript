## üß† How JavaScript Executes Code

JavaScript is a **single-threaded** language that uses the **Execution Context** and **Call Stack** to manage the execution of code.

When a JavaScript file runs, the **JavaScript engine** creates **Execution Contexts** and manages them using the **Call Stack**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Execution Context

An **Execution Context** is an environment in which JavaScript code is evaluated and executed.

There are **3 types** of Execution Contexts:

1. **Global Execution Context (GEC)**
2. **Functional Execution Context (FEC)**
3. **Eval Execution Context** *(rarely used, created by `eval()` function)*

## üß≠ Phases of Code Execution

JavaScript code is executed in **two phases**:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Memory Creation Phase (Creation Phase)

* **Memory is allocated** for all variables and functions.
* Variables are assigned **`undefined`** initially.
* Function declarations are stored in memory as-is.
* The `this` keyword is set (depends on environment: `window` in browsers).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Execution Phase

* Variables are assigned actual values.
* Functions are executed (creating new execution contexts).

## üóÇÔ∏è Example Breakdown

```javascript
let val1 = 10;
let val2 = 5;

function addNum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

let result1 = addNum(val1, val2);
let result2 = addNum(10, 2);
```

### üåÄ Memory Creation Phase (Global Execution Context):

| Variable | Value               |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| val1     | undefined           |
| val2     | undefined           |
| addNum   | function(){}        |
| result1  | undefined           |
| result2  | undefined           |
| this     | window (in browser) |

### üöÄ Execution Phase:

| Step                         | Action                                        |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| val1 = 10                    | Assign value                                  |
| val2 = 5                     | Assign value                                  |
| result1 = addNum(val1, val2) | New **Function Execution Context** is created |
| result2 = addNum(10, 2)      | New **Function Execution Context** is created |

## üåê Global Execution Context (in Browser)

* Created automatically by JavaScript engine before any code runs.
* Attached to the **`window` object** (in browsers).
* `this` inside the global context points to `window`.
* Only one Global Execution Context exists per file/runtime.

```javascript
console.log(this); // window (in browser)
```

## üîÅ Function Execution Context

Each time a function is invoked:

* A new **Function Execution Context** is created.
* It has:

  * **Variable Environment** (local memory)
  * **Scope Chain**
  * **`this` binding**
* Gets **pushed** to the **Call Stack**.

## üß± Call Stack

* A **stack data structure** used to keep track of execution contexts.
* **LIFO** (Last In, First Out).
* When a function is called ‚Üí pushed to the stack.
* When it returns ‚Üí popped off the stack.

## üìú Adding JavaScript Files in Browser

### 1. Inline JS

```html
<script>
  console.log("Hello from inline script!");
</script>
```

### 2. Internal JS

```html
<head>
  <script>
    // code here
  </script>
</head>
```

### 3. External JS

```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

## üßµ Is JavaScript Single Threaded?

Yes. JavaScript is **single-threaded**, meaning:

* Executes one command at a time.
* One **Call Stack** and one **Memory Heap**.
* **Concurrency** is achieved through asynchronous features (e.g., Event Loop, Web APIs, Promises).

## üåç Execution Contexts in Other Runtimes

Each runtime (Node.js, Deno, Bun) has:

* Their own version of the **Global Object**:

  * **Browser**: `window`
  * **Node.js**: `global`
  * **Deno**: `globalThis`
* But the **concept of execution context** remains the same.
* They differ in available APIs, not in how JS executes.

## üîÅ Summary

| Concept                      | Description                             |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Execution Context            | Environment for code execution          |
| Global Execution Context     | Created first, only once                |
| Functional Execution Context | Created for each function call          |
| Eval Execution Context       | Created by `eval()` (not commonly used) |
| Call Stack                   | Keeps track of all execution contexts   |
| Two Phases                   | 1. Memory Creation 2. Execution         |
| `this` in Browser            | Refers to `window` object               |
| Single-threaded              | JavaScript runs one task at a time      |

How to add javascript files in browsers?



Javascript Ececution Context:
- Whatever files you have created, how javascript will run/execute it.
- Javascript runs your program in two phases.
- Remember, when you give code files to javascript, first a global execution context is created.
- Global executon context is referred to a varibale called "this"

Explain the Global Execution Context in Browser?

Every runtime environments like NodeJS, Bun, DenoJS have different execution context?

In browser, the value of this varibale returns window object in browser.

It is executed in threads.
Javascript is single threaded.


Global Execution Context
Functional  Execution Context
Eval Execution Context(Property of global obejct)



How javascript code gets executed?
- 2 phases

1st phase - memory creation phase(creation phase)
- memory is  allocated for varibales etc
- 


2nd phase - Execution phase
- 1. Clobal Execution --> this
- 2. Memory creation phase: 
        - val1 = undefined
        - val2 = undefined
        - addNum = definition(for functions)
        - result1 = undefined
        - result2 = undefined
        - this is known as first cycle, and it will  always  happen
- 3. Execution phase:
        - val1 = 10
        - val2 = 5
        - addNum- creates another execution context
            - in the new execution context, new variable environment + execution thread is created
        - result1 = 
        - result2 =
