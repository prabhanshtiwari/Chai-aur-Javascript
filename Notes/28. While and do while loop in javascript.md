# 🔁 JavaScript Loop Notes

## 🔁 **`while` Loop**

### ✅ **Definition**:
A `while` loop is used **when you want to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is `true`**.

---

### ✅ **Code Snippet 1**:

```js
let index = 0
// while (index <= 10) {
//     console.log(`Value of index is ${index}`);
//     index = index + 2
// }
```

#### 🔍 **Explanation**:

* **Initialization**: `index` is set to `0`.
* **Condition**: The loop will run **as long as `index <= 10`**.
* **Increment**: `index` increases by 2 in each iteration (`index = index + 2`).
* **Output**: Logs the value of `index` on each iteration.

#### ✅ **Key Points**:

* Starts at `0` and prints every **even number up to 10**.
* Since increment is `2`, output will be:

  ```
  Value of index is 0
  Value of index is 2
  Value of index is 4
  ...
  Value of index is 10
  ```
* Useful when you need **custom increment/decrement**.

---

### ✅ **Code Snippet 2**:

```js
let myArray = ['flash', "batman", "superman"]

let arr = 0
while (arr < myArray.length) {
    // console.log(`Value is ${myArray[arr]}`);
    arr = arr + 1
}
```

#### 🔍 **Explanation**:

* **Initialization**: `arr = 0`
* **Condition**: Loop runs while `arr` is less than the **length of the array**.
* **Action**: Logs each element in `myArray`.
* **Increment**: `arr = arr + 1`

#### ✅ **Key Points**:

* `myArray.length` is `3`, so it runs from index `0` to `2`.
* Logs:

  ```
  Value is flash
  Value is batman
  Value is superman
  ```
* Good for **iterating arrays using `while`** instead of `for`.

## 🔁 **`do...while` Loop**

### ✅ **Definition**:
The `do...while` loop executes the code block **at least once**, and **then checks the condition** to determine whether to continue.

---

### ✅ **Code Snippet 3**:

```js
let score = 11;
do {
    console.log(`Score is ${score}`);
    score++
} while (score <= 10);
```

#### 🔍 **Explanation**:

* **Initialization**: `score = 11`
* **Execution**: Logs the score **before checking the condition**.
* **Condition**: `score <= 10` is false, but **still runs once**.

#### ✅ **Key Points**:

* Output:

  ```
  Score is 11
  ```
* Even though `score` was greater than `10`, it **ran once**.
* Best when you want to **ensure the code runs at least one time**.

## ✅ **Summary Table**:

| Loop Type         | Runs When Condition is True | Runs At Least Once | Use Case Example               |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `while`           | ✅                           | ❌                  | Input validation until correct |
| `do...while`      | ✅                           | ✅                  | Show menu at least once        |
| `for` (not shown) | ✅                           | ❌                  | Fixed iteration count          |

## 🧠 **Quick Tips**:

* Use `while` when **you don't know** how many times you need to loop.
* Use `do...while` when you want the loop to **run at least once**, even if the condition is false.
* Always make sure to **update the loop variable** inside the loop to avoid infinite loops.
