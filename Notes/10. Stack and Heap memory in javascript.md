# Stack and Heap Memory in JavaScript

## Memory Management in JavaScript

In earlier programming languages like C and C++, developers had to manually allocate and deallocate memory using functions like `malloc()`, `free()`, `new`, and `delete`. However, modern languages like JavaScript use **automatic memory management** through a process called **Garbage Collection (GC)**.

### How Memory Allocation Works in JavaScript?
JavaScript automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation using a mechanism called **Garbage Collection**, which is based on **reference counting** and **mark-and-sweep algorithms**.

- When a variable is created, memory is allocated.
- When a variable is no longer reachable, it becomes eligible for garbage collection.

JavaScript stores variables in two different types of memory:
1. **Stack Memory** - Used for **Primitive Data Types**
2. **Heap Memory** - Used for **Non-Primitive Data Types (Objects, Arrays, Functions)**

## Stack vs. Heap Memory

| Feature         | Stack Memory (Primitive) | Heap Memory (Non-Primitive) |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Data Types Stored | Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol, BigInt | Objects, Arrays, Functions |
| Memory Size    | Fixed (small)         | Dynamic (large)      |
| Access Speed  | Fast                   | Slower               |
| Storage       | Stored directly in the stack | Stored in heap, accessed via reference |
| Copy Behavior | Copies value (creates a separate copy) | Copies reference (points to the same memory location) |
| Memory Cleanup | Automatically managed (popped off the stack when function execution ends) | Garbage Collector handles it when no references exist |

### Diagram Representation:

```
Stack (Primitive)       Heap (Non-Primitive)
------------------      --------------------
myYoutubeName          userOne → { email: "user@google.com", upi: "user@ybl" }
"hiteshchaudhary"       userTwo → (Reference to userOne)
------------------      --------------------
```

---

## Example: Copying Primitive Values (Stack Memory)
```js
let myYoutubeName = "hiteshchaudhary";
let anotherName = myYoutubeName; // Copying value
anotherName = "chaiaurcode";

console.log(anotherName);  // Output: chaiaurcode
console.log(myYoutubeName); // Output: hiteshchaudhary
```
### Explanation:
- The value stored in `myYoutubeName` is copied to `anotherName`.
- Changing `anotherName` does **not** affect `myYoutubeName` because **primitives are stored separately in stack memory**.

---

## Example: Copying Reference Values (Heap Memory)
```js
let userOne = {
    email: "user@google.com",
    upi: "user@ybl"
};

let userTwo = userOne; // Copying reference
userTwo.email = "hitesh@google.com";

console.log(userOne.email);  // Output: hitesh@google.com
console.log(userTwo.email);  // Output: hitesh@google.com
```
### Explanation:
- `userOne` is an object stored in **Heap Memory**.
- `userTwo` is assigned the **reference** to `userOne`, not a separate copy.
- When `userTwo.email` is changed, it also changes `userOne.email` because they point to the **same memory location**.

## Key Takeaways
1. **Stack Memory** is used for **primitive data types**, where variables hold their own value.
2. **Heap Memory** is used for **objects and arrays**, where variables store a reference to the actual data.
3. **Copying primitive values creates an independent copy**, while **copying object references creates a shared reference**.
4. **Garbage Collector automatically manages memory**, freeing unused memory when no references exist.

## Interview Questions and Answers
### 1. How is memory allocated in JavaScript?
   - JavaScript automatically allocates memory when variables are declared.
   - **Primitives** are stored in **stack memory**.
   - **Objects, arrays, and functions** are stored in **heap memory**, with variables storing their references.
   - JavaScript's **Garbage Collector** removes unused objects from heap memory.

### 2. What is the difference between Stack and Heap Memory?
   - **Stack:** Stores primitive values, follows LIFO (Last In, First Out), has fast access, and creates separate copies.
   - **Heap:** Stores objects, follows dynamic memory allocation, has slower access, and shares references.

### 3. What happens when we copy primitive vs. non-primitive values?
   - **Primitive Copy (Stack):** Creates an independent copy.
   - **Object Copy (Heap):** Creates a shared reference, modifying one modifies the other.

### 4. How does JavaScript's Garbage Collection work?
   - JavaScript automatically removes unreachable objects using **Mark-and-Sweep Algorithm**.
   - If an object has no references, it gets deallocated from the heap memory.
