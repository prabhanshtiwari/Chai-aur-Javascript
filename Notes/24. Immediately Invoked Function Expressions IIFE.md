# 🔥 Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)

## 📌 Definition
An IIFE is a JavaScript function that is executed immediately after it is defined, without needing to call it separately.

```js
(function() {
    // code
})();
```

## ✅ Key Points

| Point | Explanation |
|-------|-------------|
| 🔁 Immediate Execution | Function runs as soon as it is defined |
| 🧹 Avoids Global Scope Pollution | Variables inside IIFE are scoped to that function and not accessible outside |
| 🔐 Encapsulation | Keeps your code isolated and protects variables from being accessed or modified globally |
| 📍 Useful for Initialization | Run setup code, database connections, configuration loading, etc., immediately |
| 🔚 Semicolon Needed | If you write multiple IIFEs or statements one after another, a semicolon (;) avoids syntax errors |

## 🤓 Global Scope Pollution — In Detail
In JavaScript, if you declare variables/functions globally, they are added to the `window` object in browsers or the `global` object in Node.js.
This can cause naming collisions or overwrites in large projects.

### 🔍 Problem Without IIFE:
```js
var name = "Global";

function greet() {
    var name = "Hitesh"; // If not used inside IIFE, this might overwrite or interfere with global variables
    console.log(name);
}
greet();
```

### ✅ Solution Using IIFE:
```js
(function(){
    var name = "Hitesh";
    console.log(name); // "Hitesh"
})(); 

console.log(name); // "Global" — global variable not affected
```

## 🧠 Code Snippet Breakdown & Explanations

### 1. ✅ Normal Function
```js
function chai(){
    console.log("DB CONNECTED");
}
chai(); // called manually
```

---

### 2. ✅ IIFE (Named)
```js
(function chai(){
    console.log("DB CONNECTED");
})(); // Executed immediately
```
- Function is named (`chai`) but can't be called again.
- Name helps with debugging stack traces.

---

### 3. ✅ IIFE with Arrow Function
```js
(() => {
    console.log("DB CONNECTED TWO");
})();
```
- Uses arrow function
- Compact and modern

---

### 4. ✅ IIFE with Parameters (Named Function)
```js
(function chai(name){
    console.log(\`DB CONNECTED \${name}\`);
})("hitesh");
```
- `name` parameter is passed immediately.
- Output: `DB CONNECTED hitesh`

---

### 5. ✅ IIFE with Parameters (Anonymous Arrow Function)
```js
((name) =>{
    console.log(\`DB CONNECTED \${name}\`);
})("hitesh");
```
- More concise
- Used often in **React** or modern JS setup

---

### 6. ✅ Two IIFEs in One Line
```js
(function chai(name){
    console.log(\`1 DB CONNECTED \${name}\`);
})("hitesh"), ((name) =>{
    console.log(\`2.DB CONNECTED \${name}\`);
})("hitesh");
```
- Uses **comma `,`** operator to separate two expressions
- First IIFE logs: `1 DB CONNECTED hitesh`
- Second logs: `2.DB CONNECTED hitesh`

---

## 💡 Use Cases of IIFE
- Avoid polluting the global scope in libraries or modules
- Immediately run setup/configuration code
- Create a **private scope** for variables
- Used in bundlers like Webpack, Rollup, etc.
- Used in **older JS** before ES Modules were introduced

## 🎯 Interview Tips & Questions

### ✨ Possible Questions:
- What is an IIFE and when would you use it?
- How does IIFE help in avoiding global scope pollution?
- What happens if you don’t put a semicolon after an IIFE?
- Can you pass parameters to an IIFE?

### ✅ Quick Answers:
- IIFE is a function that runs immediately when defined.
- Helps encapsulate code and avoid interfering with global variables.
- Omitting a semicolon before an IIFE (when written after another expression) can cause syntax errors.
- Yes, IIFEs can take parameters just like regular functions.
