# Deep Dive into XMLHttpRequest in JavaScript

Let’s break down and **deeply understand** the given HTML and JavaScript code. This involves concepts like the **XMLHttpRequest object**, **HTTP requests**, **readyState**, **AJAX**, and more.

---

## 🧠 THEORETICAL CONCEPTS

### 🔸 What is `XMLHttpRequest`?

`XMLHttpRequest` (XHR) is a **built-in JavaScript object** that allows you to make **HTTP requests** (like GET, POST) to servers **without reloading the page**. It's the core technology behind **AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)**.

✅ Use Cases:

* Fetch data from an API.
* Submit a form without refreshing.
* Load partial content dynamically.

### 🔸 Ready States (xhr.readyState)

XMLHttpRequest goes through **5 ready states**:

| State Number | Name              | Meaning                                                             |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0            | UNSENT            | Request object created but `open()` not called yet                  |
| 1            | OPENED            | `open()` has been called                                            |
| 2            | HEADERS_RECEIVED  | `send()` has been called; response headers and status are available |
| 3            | LOADING           | Data is being downloaded                                            |
| 4            | DONE              | Request completed (success or failure)                              |

## 🧪 CODE BREAKDOWN (Step-by-step)

### HTML Part

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
```

* Declares the document type and language (English).

```html
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Document</title>
</head>
```

* Sets character encoding to UTF-8.
* Viewport setting ensures responsiveness on different screen sizes.
* The `<title>` sets the browser tab name.

```html
<body style="background-color: #212121;">
```

* Black background using inline CSS.

```html
<!-- Comment explains the meaning of each readyState -->
```

---

### JavaScript Part

```js
const requestUrl = 'https://api.github.com/users/hiteshchoudhary'
```

* This is the **GitHub API endpoint** to fetch public data about the GitHub user `hiteshchoudhary`.

```js
const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
```

* Creates a **new XHR object** to perform an HTTP request.

```js
xhr.open('GET', requestUrl)
```

* `open(method, url)`
  * `method`: "GET" means we want to **retrieve data**.
  * `url`: the endpoint to which the request is sent.
* This moves `xhr.readyState` to **1 (OPENED)**.

```js
xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
    console.log(xhr.readyState);
    if (xhr.readyState === 4) {
        const data = JSON.parse(this.responseText)
        console.log(typeof data);
        console.log(data.followers);
    }
}
```

🔍 Let's break this further:

* `xhr.onreadystatechange` assigns a **callback function** that will run **every time the readyState changes**.
* `console.log(xhr.readyState)` logs the current state (values from 0 to 4).
* `if (xhr.readyState === 4)` checks if the request is **complete**.
* `this.responseText`: contains the **response from the API** as a **JSON string**.
* `JSON.parse(this.responseText)` converts the string to a **JavaScript object**.
* `typeof data`: logs `object`.
* `data.followers`: accesses the number of followers the user has on GitHub (from the API response).

```js
xhr.send();
```

* Sends the HTTP request. Now the actual communication begins.
* Moves `readyState` to 2, 3, then 4.

## 🧾 SAMPLE OUTPUT (Console)

If everything goes well, the console logs:

```
1
2
3
4
object
134
```

> The number 134 is just an example; it will show the actual number of followers at the time of request.

## 🔁 Flowchart Summary

1. Create a request using `XMLHttpRequest()`.
2. Configure it using `open(method, url)`.
3. Assign a callback using `onreadystatechange`.
4. Send the request using `send()`.
5. When the response is ready (`readyState === 4`), parse the data and use it.

## 📝 REAL WORLD ANALOGY

Imagine you're ordering a pizza using a phone:

* `new XMLHttpRequest()` → You pick up the phone.
* `open('GET', 'pizzaURL')` → You dial the number and say what you want.
* `send()` → You place the order.
* `onreadystatechange` → You listen to the updates from the pizza shop (Order placed → being prepared → out for delivery → delivered).
* `readyState === 4` → Pizza is delivered. You open the box and eat 🍕 (parse data and use it).
