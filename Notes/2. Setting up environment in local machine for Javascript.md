# Setting Up JavaScript Environment on Local Machine

## 1. Introduction to File Extensions

### File Extensions in Programming
- **.txt** — A simple text file that contains plain text. It has no specific structure or syntax.
- **.js** — A JavaScript source code file that follows a specific structure and syntax.

### Importance of Source Code
- Source code contains **instructions** written in a particular programming language.
- It follows a **syntax and structure** defined by the language.
- Different file extensions represent different programming languages. 

---

## 2. Executing Source Code in Software

### Execution Through Compilers and Interpreters
- **Compilers and interpreters** are software that translate source code into machine code or execute it directly.
- These tools understand the syntax and structure of the source code.

### JavaScript in Browsers
- Traditionally, JavaScript was embedded in HTML files to be executed in the browser.
- Developers used to create:
    - `index.html` — HTML file.
    - `script.js` — JavaScript file linked in the HTML using:
    ```html
    <script src="script.js"></script>
    ```
    - This file was executed by the JavaScript engine inside the browser.

---

## 3. Evolution of JavaScript Beyond Browsers

### Transition from Browser to Standalone Execution
- In the past, JavaScript execution was limited to **frontend (client-side)** through browsers.
- With the rise of **Node.js** and other runtime environments, JavaScript expanded to:
    - Backend Development
    - Mobile Applications
    - Desktop Applications
    - IoT (Internet of Things)

### Introduction of JavaScript Runtimes
- These runtimes allow JavaScript to run independently of the browser.
- Popular JavaScript environments:
    - **Node.js**
    - **Deno.js**

---

## 4. JavaScript Environments: Node.js and Deno.js

### Node.js
- **Node.js** is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be executed outside the browser.
- It is based on the **V8 Engine** (Google Chrome's JavaScript engine).
- Widely used in backend development for creating APIs, servers, and more.

### Deno.js
- **Deno.js** is a modern and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript.
- It is also built on the **V8 Engine** but has improved security and a simpler module system.

### Main Founder of Node.js and Deno.js
- **Ryan Dahl** — The creator of both Node.js and Deno.js.
    - **Node.js** — Created in 2009.
    - **Deno.js** — Created in 2018 to fix design flaws in Node.js.

## 5. Installing JavaScript Environment Locally

### Install Node.js (LTS Version Recommended)
1. Download the **LTS (Long-Term Support)** version of Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Install Node.js using the default installer.

#### Verify Installation
```bash
node -v
```

### Install Deno (Optional)
1. Install Deno using the following command:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh
```
2. Verify Deno installation:
```bash
deno --version
```

> ⚡️ **Note:** Most of the software development cycle uses **Node.js**, hence it's preferred for learning.

## 6. Choosing the Right Code Editor

### Recommended Code Editors
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** – Lightweight and extensible.
- **JetBrains Fleet** – AI-powered IDE with smooth code navigation.
- **Sublime Text** – Fast and simple text editor.

### Why Use Code Editors?
- Syntax highlighting.
- Auto-indentation.
- Auto-completion and error detection.
- Better code structure and readability.

---

## 7. Executing JavaScript Files Using Node.js

### Writing JavaScript Code
1. Create a folder named `Code` on your desktop.
2. Inside `Code`, create a sub-folder `01_basics`.
3. Create a file named `test.js`:
```javascript
console.log("Hello, JavaScript!");
```

### Open Terminal in VS Code
- Press `CTRL + ~` or `CTRL + ` to open the integrated terminal.

### Run JavaScript Code
```bash
node Code/01_basics/test.js
```

---

## 8. Why Not Write Code in Browser’s Console?

### Limitations of Browser Console
- **Temporary Execution** — Code runs temporarily and does not persist.
- **Manual Effort** — Need to manually type or paste code.
- **Limited Use Cases** — Suitable only for debugging or testing small scripts.
- **No File System Access** — Cannot read/write files or perform backend tasks.

---

## 9. JavaScript Engines

### What is a JavaScript Engine?
- A **JavaScript engine** is a program that interprets and executes JavaScript code.
- Engines parse, compile, and optimize JavaScript for faster execution.

### Popular JavaScript Engines
1. **V8 Engine** – Used in Google Chrome and Node.js.
2. **SpiderMonkey** – Used in Mozilla Firefox.
3. **JavaScriptCore** – Used in Safari.
4. **Chakra** – Used in older versions of Microsoft Edge.

---

## 10. Understanding V8 Engine

### V8 Engine Overview
- Developed by Google for the Chrome browser.
- Converts JavaScript code into machine code using a **Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler**.
- Key features:
    - High performance.
    - Supports modern JavaScript features.
    - Powers both **Chrome** and **Node.js**.

---

## 11. Key Concepts in JavaScript Execution

### Tree Parsing
- A **Tree Parser** is used to identify:
    - Keywords (`console`, `log`, `var`, `let`, etc.).
    - Syntax structure.
    - Code flow.
    
---

## 12. Summary

### Key Takeaways
- **File Extensions:** `.txt` (plain text), `.js` (JavaScript source code).
- **Execution:** Compilers and interpreters understand the structure.
- **JavaScript Runtimes:** Node.js and Deno.js, created by Ryan Dahl.
- **V8 Engine:** Powers modern JavaScript runtimes.
- **Development Environment:** Use editors like VS Code for better productivity.
- **Execution in Terminal:** Run JavaScript files using `node <file_path>`.
