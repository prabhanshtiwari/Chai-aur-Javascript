# üß† Lexical Scoping and Closures in JavaScript

---

### üìå 1. Introduction

* The video covers two critical and often misunderstood JavaScript concepts:

  * **Lexical Scoping**
  * **Closures**
* These are **fundamental for understanding advanced JavaScript behavior**, especially in real-world scenarios like React apps and event handling.

---

### üîç 2. What is Lexical Scoping?

**Definition:**

> Lexical scope refers to the **scope determined at the time of writing the code**, based on the position of functions and variables in the source code.

* **A function has access to variables defined in its own scope and the scope of its parent function.**
* **Nested functions** can access variables from their outer functions.

#### ‚úÖ Example:

```javascript
function outer() {
  let userName = "Hitesh";

  function inner() {
    console.log(userName); // ‚úÖ Accessible
  }

  inner();
}

outer();
```

* `inner()` function has **access to `userName`** due to lexical scoping.

#### ‚ùå Counterexample:

```javascript
function outer() {
  let userName = "Hitesh";
}

console.log(userName); // ‚ùå ReferenceError: userName is not defined
```

* Outside `outer()`, the variable is **not accessible**.

---

### üí° 3. Analogy to Understand Lexical Scope

* Think of it like a **family**:

  * Children can access things from their parents (scope).
  * Parents cannot access the secrets or private variables of their children.
  * Siblings do **not share variables** between each other.

---

### üß™ 4. Lexical Scope in Practice

* Variables declared in **outer functions** are **available to inner functions**, but the reverse is not true.

#### Multi-level Example:

```javascript
function outer() {
  let secret = "123";

  function inner() {
    console.log(secret); // ‚úÖ Accessible
  }

  function inner2() {
    console.log(secret); // ‚úÖ Accessible
  }

  inner();
  inner2();
}

outer();
```

* Both `inner()` and `inner2()` can access `secret`.

However:

```javascript
function outer() {
  function inner() {
    let secret = "123";
  }

  function inner2() {
    console.log(secret); // ‚ùå Error
  }

  inner();
  inner2();
}
```

* `inner2()` cannot access `secret` because it's **declared inside `inner()`** and **not in the outer scope**.

---

### üß© 5. What is a Closure?

**Definition (MDN Inspired):**

> A **closure** is the combination of a function bundled together with references to its surrounding (lexical) scope.

This means:

* A function can "remember" the scope in which it was created.
* **Even after the outer function has finished execution**, the inner function **still retains access to the variables** of the outer function.

---

### üîÅ 6. Closure in Action

#### Example:

```javascript
function makeFan() {
  let name = "Mozilla";

  function displayName() {
    console.log(name); // ‚úÖ Will print "Mozilla"
  }

  return displayName;
}

const myFunc = makeFan();
myFunc(); // Prints: Mozilla
```

* Even though `makeFan()` has finished execution, `displayName()` still has access to `name`.

‚úÖ This is **closure in action**.
üß† The inner function **remembers its lexical environment**.

---

### üéØ 7. Why Closures Are Important

* **Used in real-world development** like:

  * Event handlers
  * React hooks
  * Currying
  * Data privacy

---

### üõ†Ô∏è 8. Real World Example Using Closures

#### Use Case: Setting background color on button click

Instead of repeating code for multiple buttons:

```javascript
function clickHandler(color) {
  return function () {
    document.body.style.backgroundColor = color;
  }
}

document.getElementById("orange").onclick = clickHandler("orange");
document.getElementById("green").onclick = clickHandler("green");
```

* Each click calls the handler created by `clickHandler()`.
* Even though the outer function `clickHandler()` has returned, the inner anonymous function still **remembers the `color` variable**.
* This is a closure in practice.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Interview Questions

1. **What is Lexical Scope?**

   * Scope defined by the structure of your code (nested functions can access parent variables).

2. **What is a Closure?**

   * A function that remembers variables from its lexical scope even after the outer function has returned.

3. **What gets returned in a closure?**

   * Not just the function, but also the entire **lexical environment** required by that function.

4. **Can sibling functions access each other‚Äôs variables?**

   * No. Only inner functions can access their parent‚Äôs scope.

5. **Why do closures matter in event handling?**

   * Because they let event handlers remember context-specific values like button color, user data, etc.

| Concept   | Lexical Scope                     | Closure                             |
| --------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Meaning   | Scope based on code position      | Function + its outer scope          |
| Use Case  | Variable accessibility            | Retain access after outer execution |
| Access    | Inner functions access outer vars | Even after parent is done           |
| Common In | All JS functions                  | Callbacks, handlers, React          |
