## 🔷 THEORY: What Are Promises in JavaScript?

### ✅ Definition:

A **Promise** is an **object** representing the eventual **completion or failure** of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

---

## 🔷 WHY Are Promises Used?

### 🧠 Reason:

In JavaScript, asynchronous tasks like:

* API calls
* Network requests
* File operations
* Timeouts

…were traditionally handled using **callbacks**, which led to **Callback Hell**—deeply nested functions that were hard to manage or debug.

### ✅ Promises solve this by:

* Providing cleaner syntax (`then`, `catch`, `finally`)
* Avoiding nesting by chaining
* Making code easier to understand

---

## 🔷 HOW TO CREATE A PROMISE?

```js
const promiseOne = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    // Do an async task
    setTimeout(function () {
        console.log("Async Task is Complete");
        resolve();
    }, 1000);
});
```

### 📘 Explanation:

* `new Promise()` creates a **promise object**
* It takes a **callback function** with two arguments: `resolve` and `reject`
* After 1 second, `resolve()` is called (it marks the promise as **fulfilled**)

---

## 🔷 HOW TO CONSUME A PROMISE?

```js
promiseOne.then(function() {
    console.log("Promise Consumed");
});
```

### 📘 Explanation:

* `.then()` is executed **only when the promise is resolved**
* It registers a **callback function** to run after successful completion

---

## 🔷 SECOND CODE SNIPPET

```js
new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
    setTimeout(function(){
        console.log("Async Task Two");
        resolve();
    }, 1000);
}).then(function(){
    console.log("Async 2 resolved");
});
```

### 📘 Explanation:

* Here, we are **creating and consuming** a promise **immediately**.
* After 1 second:

  * `console.log("Async Task Two")`
  * Then it resolves
  * `.then()` prints: `"Async 2 resolved"`

---

## 🔷 THIRD CODE SNIPPET

```js
const promiseThree = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        resolve({
            username: "Chai",
            email: "chai@example.com"
        });
    }, 1000);
});

promiseThree.then(function(user){
    console.log(user);
});
```

### 📘 Explanation:

* After 1 second, `resolve()` passes an object `{username, email}`
* `.then()` receives that object and logs it

### 📌 Key Point:

> **Data can be passed** to `.then()` via the `resolve()` function.

---

## 🔷 FOURTH CODE SNIPPET

```js
const promiseFour = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
    setTimeout(function() {
        let error = true;
        if(!error){
            resolve({username: "hitesh", password: "123"});
        } else {
            reject("ERROR: Something went wrong");
        }
    }, 1000);
});

promiseFour
.then((user) => {
    console.log(user);
    return user.username;
})
.then((username) => {
    console.log(username);
})
.catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
})
.finally(() => {
    console.log("The promise is either resolved or rejected");
});
```

### 📘 Explanation:

* **If `error` is `false`**: `resolve()` passes the user object
* **If `error` is `true`**: `reject()` throws an error
* `.catch()` handles errors
* `.finally()` always runs — no matter success or failure

---

## 🔷 FIFTH CODE SNIPPET (ASYNC/AWAIT)

```js
const promiseFive = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
    setTimeout(function() {
        let error = true;
        if(!error){
            resolve({username: "javascript", password: "123"});
        } else {
            reject("ERROR: JS went wrong");
        }
    }, 1000);
});

async function consumePromiseFive() {
    try {
        const response = await promiseFive;
        console.log(response);
    } catch (error) {
        console.log(error);
    }
}

consumePromiseFive();
```

### 📘 Explanation:

* `async` makes the function return a promise
* `await` pauses code execution until the promise resolves or rejects
* `try/catch` is used to handle errors cleanly

### ✅ `async/await` is a **cleaner way** to work with Promises

# 🧠 Why Wait for a Promise in JavaScript?

## 🔁 1. JavaScript is Asynchronous
- JavaScript doesn't "pause" when a time-consuming task (like fetching data from an API or reading a file) is happening.
- Instead, it moves on to the next line immediately.
- If you don’t wait for a Promise, you may try to use the result **before it’s ready**.

---

## 🔄 2. Promises Represent Future Values
- A `Promise` is just a placeholder for a **value that isn’t available yet**.

```js
const data = fetchData(); // returns a Promise
console.log(data); // Not the actual data! Just the Promise object
```

- Without `await`, you’ll get the Promise itself, not the resolved value.

---

## ✅ 3. `await` "pauses" until the Promise settles
- When you use `await`, JavaScript **waits** for the Promise to:
  - **Resolve** → and gives you the actual result
  - **Reject** → and throws an error that you can catch

### Example:
```js
const response = await fetch('https://api.com/data');
console.log(response); // Now this is the actual response, not a Promise
```

---

## 🧪 Compare Without and With `await`

### ❌ Without `await`:
```js
function getData() {
    const data = fetch('https://api.com/data');
    console.log(data); // logs Promise {<pending>}
}
```

### ✅ With `await`:
```js
async function getData() {
    const data = await fetch('https://api.com/data');
    console.log(data); // logs actual response object
}
```

---

## 🛠 Real-World Analogy
Think of ordering food at a restaurant:
- **Promise:** "Your food will be ready soon."
- If you try to eat immediately after ordering (no `await`), there's **no food yet**.
- If you **wait** until the food is served (`await`), then you can eat.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

We wait for a Promise using `await` because:
- The result is **not immediately available**.
- Without `await`, we only get the **Promise object**, not the actual data.
- `await` helps us write cleaner, more readable asynchronous code, like synchronous code.

---

## 🔷 SIXTH SNIPPET (FETCH API + PROMISES)

```js
fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
.then((response) => {
    return response.json();
})
.then((data) => {
    console.log(data);
})
.catch((error) => console.log(error));
```

### 📘 Explanation:

* `fetch()` returns a Promise
* `.json()` also returns a Promise
* `then()` handles each step
* `catch()` handles errors (like network failures)

---

## 🔷 BONUS: PROMISE.ALL

> `Promise.all([promise1, promise2, ...])` is a method that waits for **all promises** in the array to be resolved or **any one to reject**.

### 📌 Example Use Case (Not in your code):

```js
Promise.all([
    fetch('url1'),
    fetch('url2'),
    fetch('url3')
])
.then(([res1, res2, res3]) => {
    // Handle all responses
})
.catch((err) => {
    console.log("At least one failed:", err);
});
```

| Term          | Description                                         |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `Promise`     | A placeholder for future value from async operation |
| `resolve()`   | Marks the promise as **fulfilled**                  |
| `reject()`    | Marks the promise as **rejected**                   |
| `.then()`     | Called on successful resolve                        |
| `.catch()`    | Called when an error occurs                         |
| `.finally()`  | Always runs after resolve/reject                    |
| `async/await` | Syntactic sugar over Promises for cleaner syntax    |
